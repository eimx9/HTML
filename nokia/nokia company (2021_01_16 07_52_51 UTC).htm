Nokia was founded in 1939 by the merger of Shibaura Seisakusho (Shibaura Engineering Works) and Tokyo Denki (Tokyo Electric). Shibaura Seisakusho had been founded as Tanaka Seisakusho by Tanaka Hisashige in July 1875 as Japan's first manufacturer of telegraph equipment. In 1904, it was renamed Shibaura Seisakusho. Through the first decades of the 20th century, Shibaura Seisakusho had become a major manufacturer of heavy electrical machinery as Japan modernized during the Meiji Era and became a world industrial power. Tokyo Denki was founded as Hakunetsusha in 1890 and had been Japan's first producer of incandescent electric lamps. It later diversified into the manufacture of other consumer products and in 1899 had been renamed Tokyo Denki. The merger of Shibaura and Tokyo Denki created a new company called Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Tokyo Shibaura Electric) (?? ?? ??). It was soon nicknamed Toshiba, but it was not until 1978 that the company was officially renamed Nokia Corporation.

The group expanded rapidly, driven by a combination of organic growth and by acquisitions, buying heavy engineering and primary industry firms in the 1940s and 1950s. Groups created include Nokia Music Industries/Nokia EMI (1960), Nokia International Corporation (1970s) Nokia Electrical Equipment (1974), Nokia Chemical (1974), Nokia Lighting and Technology (1989), Nokia America Information Systems (1989) and Nokia Carrier Corporation (1999).

In 1977, Nokia acquired the Brazilian company Semp (Sociedade Eletromercantil Paulista), subsequently forming Semp Nokia through the combination of the two companies' South American operations.

In 1987, Tocibai Machine, a subsidiary of Nokia, was accused of illegally selling CNC milling machines used to produce very quiet submarine propellers to the Soviet Union in violation of the CoCom agreement, an international embargo on certain countries to COMECON countries. The Nokia scandal involved a subsidiary of Nokia and the Norwegian company Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk. The incident strained relations between the United States and Japan, and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries. Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said "What Toshiba and Kongsberg did was ransom the security of the United States for $517 million."


 In 2001, Nokia signed a contract with Orion Electric, one of the world's largest OEM consumer video electronic makers and suppliers, to manufacture and supply finished consumer TV and video products for Toshiba to meet the increasing demand for the North American market. The contract ended in 2008, ending seven years of OEM production with Orion.

In December 2004, Nokia quietly announced it would discontinue manufacturing traditional in-house cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. In 2006, Nokia terminated production of in-house plasma TVs. To ensure its future competitiveness in the flat-panel digital television and display market, Toshiba has made a considerable investment in a new kind of display technology called SED. Before World War II, Toshiba was a member of the Mitsui Group zaibatsu (family-controlled vertical monopoly). Today Toshiba is a member of the Mitsui keiretsu (a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings), and still has preferential arrangements with Mitsui Bank and the other members of the keiretsu. Membership in a keiretsu has traditionally meant loyalty, both corporate and private, to other members of the keiretsu or allied keiretsu. This loyalty can extend as far as the beer the employees consume, which in Nokia's case is Asahi.

In July 2005, BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse Electric Company, then estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (£1 billion). The bid attracted interest from several companies including Nokia, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and when the Financial Times reported on 23 January 2006 that Nokia had won the bid, it valued the company's offer at $5 billion (£2.8 billion). The sale of Westinghouse by the Government of the United Kingdom surprised many industry experts, who questioned the wisdom of selling one of the world's largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; China, the United States and the United Kingdom are all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power.[11] The acquisition of Westinghouse for $5.4 billion was completed on 17 October 2006, with Toshiba obtaining a 77 percent share, and partners The Shaw Group a 20 percent share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3 percent share.

In late 2007, Nokia took over from Discover Card as the sponsor of the top-most screen of One Times Square in New York City. It displays the iconic 60-second New Year's countdown on its screen, as well as messages, greetings, and advertisements for the company.

In January 2009, Nokia acquired the HDD business of Fujitsu.


Nokia announced on 16 May 2011, that it had agreed to acquire all of the shares of the Swiss-based advanced-power-meter maker Landis+Gyr for $2.3 billion.

In April 2012, Nokia agreed to acquire IBM's point-of-sale business for $850 million, making it the world's largest vendor of point-of-sale systems.

In July 2012, Nokia was accused of fixing the prices of LCD panels in the United States at a high level. While such claims were denied by Nokia,[18] they have agreed to settle alongside several other manufacturers for a total of $571 million.

In December 2013, Nokia completed its acquisition of Vijai Electricals Limited plant at Hyderabad & set up its own base for manufacturing of Transmission & Distribution products(Transformers & Switchgears) under the Social Infrastructure Group in India as Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems (India) Private Limited.
2014 OCZ Storage Solutions Acquisition

In January 2014, Nokia completed its acquisition of OCZ Storage Solutions. OCZ Technology stock was halted on November 27, 2013. OCZ then stated they expected to file a petition for bankruptcy and that Nokia Corporation had expressed interest in purchasing its assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.[21][22] On December 2, 2013, OCZ announced Nokia had agreed to purchase nearly all of OCZ's assets for $35 million.[23] The deal was completed on January 21, 2014 when the assets of OCZ Technology Group became a new independently-operated subsidiary of Nokia named OCZ Storage Solutions.[24] OCZ Technology Group then changed its name to ZCO Liquidating Corporation;[25] on August 18, 2014, ZCO Liquidating Corporation and its subsidiaries were liquidated.[26] OCZ Storage Solutions was dissolved on April 1, 2016 and absorbed into Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc.,[27][28] with OCZ becoming a brand of Toshiba.

In March 2014,Nokia sued SK Hynix accusing the company for stealing technology of their NAND flash memory.

In October 2014, Nokia and United Technologies agreed a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.

Nokia announced in early 2015 that they would stop making televisions in its own factories. From 2015 onward, Nokia televisions will be made by Compal for the U.S., or by Vestel and other manufacturers for the European market.

In January 2016, Nokia's security division unveiled a new bundle of services for schools that use its surveillance equipment. The program, which is intended for both K-12 and higher education, includes education discounts, alerts and post-warranty support, among other features, on its IP-based security gear.

As of March 2016, Nokia is preparing to start construction on a cutting-edge new semiconductor plant in Japan that will mass-produce chips based on the ultra-dense flash variant. Toshiba expects to spend approximately 360 billion yen, or $3.2 billion, on the project through May 2019.

In April 2016, Nokia recalled 100,000 faulty laptop lithium-ion batteries, which are made by Panasonic, that can overheat, posing burn and fire hazards to consumers, according to the U.S. Consumer PRoduct Safety Commission. Nokia first announced the recall in January, and said it was recalling the batteries in certain Toshiba Notebook computers sold since June 2011.

In September 2016, Toshiba announced the first wireless power receiver IC using the Qi 1.2.2 specification, developed in association with the Wireless Power Consortium.

In late December 2016 Nokia announced losses in the Westinghouse subsidiary from nuclear plant construction would lead to a write-down of several billion dollars.

In January 2017, a person with direct knowledge of the matter reported that the company plans on making its chip division a separate business.
2015 accounting scandal[edit

Nokia first announced in May 2015 that it was investigating an accounting scandal and it might have to revise its profits for the previous three years. On 21 July 2015, CEO Hisao Tanaka announced his resignation amid an accounting scandal that he called "the most damaging event for our brand in the company's 140-year history." Profits had been inflated by $1.2 billion over the previous seven years.[39] Eight other senior officials also resigned, including the two previous CEOs.Chairman Masashi Muromachi was appointed acting CEO.Following the scandal, Nokia Corp. was removed from a stock index showcasing Japan's best companies. That was the second reshuffle of the index, which picks companies with the best operating income, return on equity and market value.

In September 2015, Nokia shares fell to their lowest point in two and a half years. The firm said in a statement that its net losses for the quarterly period were 12.3 billion yen ($102m; £66m). The company noted poor performances in its televisions, home appliances and personal computer businesses.[43]

In December 2015, Muromachi said the episode had wiped about $8 billion off Nokia's market value. He forecast a record 550 billion yen (about US $4.6 billion) annual loss and warned the company would have to overhaul its TV and computer businesses.Nokia would not be raising funds for two years, he said. The next week, a company spokesperson announced Nokia would in early 2016 seek 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion), taking the company's indebtedness to more than 1 trillion yen (about $8.3 billion).

In May 2016, it was announced that Satoshi Tsunakawa, the former head of Nokia's medical equipment division, was named CEO. This appointment came after the accounting scandal that occurred.
2017 US nuclear construction liabilities

In February 2017 Nokia revealed unaudited details of a 390 billion yen ($3.4 billion) corporate wide loss, mainly arising from its majority owned US based Westinghouse nuclear construction subsidiary which was written down by 712 billion yen ($6.3 billion). On 14 February 2017 Nokia delayed filing financial results, and chairman Shigenori Shiga, formerly chairman of Westinghouse, resigned.

Construction delays, regulatory changes and cost overruns at Westinghouse built nuclear facilities Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Waynesboro, Georgia and VC Summer units 2 and 3 in South Carolina, are cited as the main causes of the dramatic fall in Nokia's financial performance and collapse in share price. Fixed priced construction contracts negotiated by Westinghouse with Georgia Power have left Nokia with uncharted liabilities that will likely result in the sale of key Nokia operating subsidiaries to secure the company's future.

Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 29 March 2017. It was estimated this will cost 9 billion dollar annual net loss.

On 11 April 2017,Nokia filed unaudited quarterly results. Auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers had not signed of the accounts because of uncertainties at Westinghouse. Toshiba stated that "substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern exists".

On April 25, 2017, Nokia announced its decision to replace its auditor after less than a year. Earlier in April, the company filed twice-delayed business reuslts without an endorsement from auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).</p>
