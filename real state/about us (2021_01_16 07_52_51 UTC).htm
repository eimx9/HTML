<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Culture: is the growing of micro-organisms, tissues, cells, or other living matter in a specially prepared nutrient or culture medium containing carbohydrates to act as a source of energy along with various mineral ions, extra proteins and vitamins. E.g. Agar 

Agar is a substance which dissolves in hot water, and sets to form a jelly. 
You pour hot agar containing all necessary nutrients into a petri-dish and leave it to cool and set before you add any micro-organisms. The other way to provide nutrients for growing micro-organisms is as a broth in a culture flask. Whichever way you do it, warmth and oxygen usually need to be provided as well.

You need to take great care when you culture micro-organisms. Even when the micro-organisms you want to grow are completely harmless, there is always the risk that a mutation may take place, resulting in a new and dangerous pathogen. Also your culture may be contaminated by 
pathogens that are present in the air, soil or water around you. So whenever you are culturing micro-organisms, you must carry out very strict health and safety procedures.
