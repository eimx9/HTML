<dfn style="font-size:450%;">history</dfn> Use of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18<sub>th</sub> century, when mutton pies known as a Kit-Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Catling.

The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York in the United Kingdom, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920<sub>s</sub>, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930<sub>s</sub>, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued. The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that <i>"a man could take to work in his pack"</i>. The bar launched on 29<sub>th</sub>August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2dollar), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.

The product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate "Break" into its recognisable advertising strategy.The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue. After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.

Following on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940<sub>s</sub> Kit Kat was exported to <ol>
<li.Canada</li>
<li> South Africa</li> 
<li>Ireland </li>
<li>Australia</li> \
</li>and New Zealand</li>
</ol>In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line<i> "Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat"</i>. The brand further expanded in the 1970<sub>s </sub>when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and Fujiya companies, respectively.

<p>When first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945–1947. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Since its introduction in the 1970<sub>s</sub>, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of<i> "Kit Kat Chunky" </i>is known as<i> "Big Kat"</i>.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, flow wrap plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.</p>

<p>In Norway, a similar product is manufactured by Mondelez International and sold as Kvikk Lunsj; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.</p>
