<h3 style="font-family:verdana;" style="color:darkblue:" >1.history</h3>

Use of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18<sub>th</sub> century, when mutton pies known as a Kit-Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Catling.

The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York in the United Kingdom, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920<sub>s</sub>, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930<sub>s</sub>, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued. The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that <i>"a man could take to work in his pack"</i>. The bar launched on 29<sub>th</sub>August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2dollar), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.

The product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate "Break" into its recognisable advertising strategy.The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue. After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.

Following on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940<sub>s</sub> Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line<i> "Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat"</i>. The brand further expanded in the 1970<sub>s </sub>when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and Fujiya companies, respectively.

<h3 style="font-family:verdana;" style="color:darkblue:">2.design</h3>

<p>When first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945–1947. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Since its introduction in the 1970<sub>s</sub>, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of<i> "Kit Kat Chunky" </i>is known as<i> "Big Kat"</i>.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, flow wrap plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.</p>

<p>In Norway, a similar product is manufactured by Mondelez International and sold as Kvikk Lunsj; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.</p>


<h3 style="font-family:verdana;" style="color:darkblue:">3.Marketing and promotion</h3>

<p>After launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as <i>"the biggest little meal"</i> and <i>"the best companion to a cup of tea"</i>. During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan <i>"what active people need"</i>. 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940<sub>s</sub> to emphasise the <i>"rich full cream milk" </i>qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.</p>

<p>Since 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been<i> "Have a break... have a Kit Kat" style="color:darkblue:"</i>. However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the <i>"Have a break" </i>portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the European Court of Justice ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the British courts. In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan <i>"Make the most of your break"</i>,but later returned to the original slogan.</p>

<h4 style="color:darkblue:">4.1.Flavours</h4>
<h5>Kit Kat Matcha</h5>

<p>Many varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as <i>"St. Valentine's Day"</i>.[citation needed] In Japan, Nestlé has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000, including; <p>
<ulstyle="list-style-type:star">
<li>ginger ale</li>
<li> soy sauce</li>
<li> creme brulee </li>
<li>green tea</li>
 <li>sake and </li>
<li>banana</li>
</ul>
<p>The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers, and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase <i>"Kitto Katsu"</i>, roughly translating as <i>"surely win"</i></p>

<p>The Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint.[citation needed] All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies & Cream.</p>
