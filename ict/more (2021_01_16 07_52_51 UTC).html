<h4>
            Madeleine Chéruit</h4>
        </h4>
              <p><ul><li>She may not be a household name like Coco Chanel or Elsa Schiaparelli, but the fact is Madeleine Chéruit helped pave the way for female fashion designers,
 becoming one
 of the first women to control a major French fashion house, at the turn of the century.</li><li> Chéruit got her start working as a dressmaker at Raudnitz & Cie House of
 Couture in the late 1880s, but her talent was so exceptional that she eventually took over the salon and its more than 100 employees in 1905, renaming it Chéruit.
</li><li> 
She helped launch the career of Paul Poiret by supporting his designs, won the praise of Vogue, and was one of the few couture houses that remained open during WWI.
</li><li> 
Though the house shuttered in 1935, Chéruit's influence in fashion design--and particularly female fashion design--can still be felt. In fact, it was Elsa Schiaparelli 
who famously took over Chéruit's 98-room studio and salon, forever tying the two designers together.</li></ul></p>

<p><ul><li>Considered by many to be one of the first female couturiers, Paquin was known for her fashionable eighteenth century-inspired pastel evening dresses, as
 well as for her
\ "publicity stunts",</li><li> which in early twentieth century Paris meant organizing fashion parades (the runway show predecessor) and sending outfitted models to
 society events like operas and races.</li><li> Sacre Bleu!

 clothes for her daughter that were so beautiful, a number of wealthy people began requesting copies for their own children, and the designer happily obliged.
</li><li> Lanvin was born--as a childrens wear label. </li><li>Soon, though, mothers began requesting similar designs that they themselves could wear, and within years the business had grown to include womenswear, perfume and home design, making Lanvin the first designer to see the potential of a lifestyle brand. </li><li>

 simple silhouettes and
 frugal use of fabrics (particularly during WWII) helped shape the democratic and casual sensibility that we associate with American ready-to-wear today.</li><li> Her
 influence was so great that in 1950, President Harry S.</li><li> Truman presented her with the Women's National Press Club Award, making her the first fashion designer

 clothing for chorus girls in Los Angeles, eventually making it to the silver screen, creating wardrobes for seminal films like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and Anna and
 The King of Siam.</li><li> Among some of her innovations, according to Minniti, was the minimal use of seams and darts, and the introduction of layered outfits that

        <h4>
            Phoebe Philo
        </h4>
   
<ul><li>It's no secret that Philo is one of the most respected and powerful designers working today: She's responsible for making Celine, and previously, Chloe, cool again and tops just about everyone's list as #1 girl crush.</li><li> 
In addition to being an excellent fashion designer, a pregnant Philo blazed a trail when she decided to scale back her Fall 2012 show due to a looming delivery date, garnering praise from other female designers for sticking up for her priorities.</li></ul></p>
