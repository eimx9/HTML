<p>In honor of the women that have blazed the trail in fashion design, we take a look at the 25 most influential female designers, with the help of Parsons' Francesca
 Granata and Pratt's Jennifer Minniti.The upcoming Costume Institute exhibit and Monday's Met Ball honors two of fashion's most beloved women designers: Elsa Schiapare
lli and Miuccia Prada.<br> But what about the other female names that have helped to change fashion forever?</p>
<p>Recently, Style.com's Nicole Phelps noted that in New York fashion today there is a surprising lack of big-name female designers, which begged the question:<br> "Is it 
easier to succeed in New York fashion as a man?" Phelps certainly has a point: After all, in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund's eight year history, the prize has only been
 awarded to women designers twice.<br> </p>
<p>The dearth of female designers in New  is particularly disheartening, when you consider the important role women have played in shaping fashion's past and present. 
From Coco Chanel, to Phoebe Philo, female designers have provided a fresh--and needed--perspective on fashion and in many cases, they changed the industry as we know it. 
So, in honor of those women that have blazed the trail in fashion design, we take a look at the 25 most influential female designers, with the help of Parsons' Francesca
Granata and Pratt's Jennifer Minniti.<br> Scroll through and get inspired.</p>
